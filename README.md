![A picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danjampro/DeepScan/master/examples/example_deblending.png)

DeepScan is a tool designed to detect low surface brightness features in astronomical data without fragmenting extended structure. The software was originally introduced in [Prole et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty1021).

DeepScan has gone through significant changes since its first release. The most recent development has been the introduction of a de-blending algorithm designed to overcome limitations encountered by other software.

Please see the examples to see how to use DeepScan. 

The software is still very much in development and any questions or feedback would be welcomed.

**Installation:**

	$pip install deepscan
